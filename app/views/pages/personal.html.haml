%p I am a 28 year old self-employed software developer, splitting my time between running my own company and working as Technical Director for Meducation. Iâ€™m getting increasingly involved in the Open Source community and you can find me on GitHub and RubyGems. I have contributed to Rails, Foreigner, HAML, and manage super_sti and belongs_to_enum.
%p I live in Birmingham, UK and shun an office in favour of working out of various Starbucks. I am married to the beautiful Liz and am surrounded by amazing friends. I used to play Ultimate Frisbee, and was president of them University of Birmingham team and played UTB (Ultimate Team Birmingham), captaining them in 2005 in the A tour. I now play football 3/4 times a week.
%p I hope you find this blog enjoyable and useful. If you want even more, you can follow me on Twitter @iHiD.
