%h2 Writing
%p I like to learn new things, and I love sharing that knowledge with others. I'm trying to find more time to put that knowledge into words, and thought having a page of articles that people have appreciated would be good motivation for me. So... 
%p Here are some articles that I've written that people seem to have appreciated.
